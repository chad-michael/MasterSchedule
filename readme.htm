        <br />
        <span style="font-size: 12pt">Email</span><br />
    </strong><span style="font-size: 12pt">In the web.config file there under AppSettings
        there is a number of keys to configure the email settings. Emails are sent to a
        faculty member when the change they submitted is approved or denied. An optional
        "Admin" email is sent only when a change has been approved. To change the formatting
        of the emails you will have to modify the stringbuilder in NeedsApproval.aspx.cs.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Pending Schedule Changes</strong><br />
        When viewing a course the pending changes are listed underneath. If you make a change
        it will show up immediately. When it is approved or denied it will be removed since
        it is not "Pending" any more. Everyone can see the pending changes list when they
        are viewing course details. Division chair persons will see a message on the Home
        page if there are pending changes that require their attention. They can click on
        the "View Pending Changes" link which will show them only the changes that are relevant
        to the departments in their division. They can then "Approve" or "Ignore" the change.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Authentication &amp; Access Control</strong><br />
        Authentication is based off of Delta's LDAP/AD security. AD groups do not play a
        role in access control. The only access control used is a lookup of the currently
        logged in users' name to determine if they are division chair.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Controls<br />
        </strong>In ViewSection.aspx each tab is associated to a control in the Controls
        folder. The AddCourse.aspx uses the same principle but the control name is postpended
        _New.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Change log messages<br />
        </strong>In each control there is usually a StringBuilder class that is used to
        build the "Change" message. HTML is used to format the message so if the format
        needs to be changed you will have to go into each one of those controls and change
        how it is comprised.</span></span>
